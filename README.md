# Cloud-School
## Brief introduction
Cloud School is an APP designed by me when I was studying system design. In view of the current epidemic situation, more and more schools choose to teach online. However, there are many problems in online teaching. This APP designed by us has realized many functions of online teaching, such as live teaching, online check-in, announcement and leave management.
## Technical realization
- Our core function is live online teaching, so we rented a cloud server and deployed SRS on it. On the android side, we used yasea for streaming and vitamio for taking the stream.
- Other functions are mainly realized by data transmission between android and server.
- On the front-end design, we called some APIs, such as ShadowView.
